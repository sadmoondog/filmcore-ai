# Update your package.json

Since you're getting the error "Missing script: deploy", you need to add the following scripts to your package.json file:

Open your package.json file and add these lines to the "scripts" section:

```json
"predeploy": "npm run build",
"deploy": "gh-pages -d dist"
```

Your scripts section should look something like this:

```json
"scripts": {
  "dev": "vite",
  "build": "tsc && vite build",
  "preview": "vite preview",
  "predeploy": "npm run build",
  "deploy": "gh-pages -d dist"
}
```

After making these changes, you can run:

```
npm run deploy
```

This will build your project and deploy it to GitHub Pages.
